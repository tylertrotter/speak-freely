# Speak freely
Speak freely is a game in the vein of catch phrase and taboo but with a few extra doodads to complicate things. It is a part of a thing I'm doing called [6Prototypes](http://tylertrotter.com/6prototypes). 

## Rules
The rules are in flux right now. As I get time to add functionality the rules will change, but the basics of the game are: 2 teams, 6 two-minute rounds for each team, a player tries to get teammates to guess as many random words as possible in each round. You get points for each word and lose points for passing on words. 

## Words
What will make or break this game is the word list. Right now I'm getting the words from this list (filtering out a few that don't make sense ). Points are awarded (or taken away) based on the difficulty of the word. I determine the difficulty based on the number of page views that word's Wikipedia page has (which I got here). The rationale being that the more obscure and difficult words would have fewer page views. This is sometimes true but not a perfect indicator. Some simple words are just boring (eg bathtub ). In future versions I need to rethink my word list. I'd also like to have categories. 

## Planned enhancements
### Restrictions
I hope to add rotating and random restrictions on what the speaker can do. Eg "can't use the letter D" or "can't speak at all". I'm thinking the restriction would change 4 times in one round. 

### Boons and bombs
I'm thinking that while the words are coming there will also randomly pop up Good icons and bad icons. These won't stay up long and will probably look somewhat similar. Clicking on good icons will give you bonus points or time and bad icons the reverse.
